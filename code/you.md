You Raise Me Up
When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary;
When troubles come and my heart burdend be;
Then, I am still and wait here in the silence,
Untill you come and sit awhile with me.
You Raise me up,so I can stand on mountains;
You Raise me up, when I am on your shoulders;
I am strong,when i am on your shoulds;
You raise me up:To more than I can be.
